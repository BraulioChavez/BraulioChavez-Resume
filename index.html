        <p class="lead mb-4">Since very young of age I have been motivated to learn new experiences in different fields of work. The very first one that I can remember is a mobile carwash that was started by my cousin. When I was around 15 years of age I started learning the different methods of how to cash a car and the different correct procedures to not harm the paint job or other items of the car. With some months of experience, I could wash and detail some cars on my own. I believe that having these types of experiences since I was very young helped to improve my personality as it taught me that there would be better ways to complete a certain task. For me at the moment was how to wash a car faster or how to polish the paint better. As I continued to work washing cars I was able to learn how to do better jobs by myself by practicing in my own car.
<br><br>

        After working for almost a year on washing and detailing cars I decided to go into construction for a time to learn new things. This job experience helped me a lot as it improved my knowledge of how to install a lot of items that can be found everywhere in a household. The experience of working in construction helped me become a person more organized with the materials used on the job site. It also taught me to be aware of my surroundings as a lot of people are constantly working and in a matter of time an accident would happen. My journey working on a construction site lasted for about three months as I started going to college. I wanted to keep myself focused on schoolwork only and not get distracted at the time.<br><br>

        After some time in college, I decided to look for a job that would keep me busy during the summer. Which in my mind was working in a warehouse. Even though I had to look for interviews for about half a month I was able to go into one and got accepted in the job position. In the beginning, I just wanted to last about three months so I could get familiar with the environment. But after about a month I was already working as if I had the experience of a year in the job. With the help of the supervisors and managers I was able to obtain a part-time position which allowed me to go to school during the week while on the weekends having to go to work. Currently, I'm about to be in this job for one year and eight months and I can say that I have been to all the departments of the warehouse. I really enjoy learning new things as I find it very useful for me in the future. My ongoing plans are to keep working on this site till I graduate from college and be able to look for a job that actually is for what I worked really hard in college.
